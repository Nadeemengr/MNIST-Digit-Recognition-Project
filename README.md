This project is a handwritten digit recognition system using deep learning
It predicts digits from 0 to 9 based on the MNIST dataset of handwritten images.
The project uses ANN (Artificial Neural Network) or CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) to classify images accurately
Recognize handwritten digits automatically
Apply deep learning models (ANN/CNN) for image classification
Provide a simple interface for predictions
